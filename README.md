A Banking System is a platform that manages the financial transactions and services provided by banks to customers. It allows users to perform essential banking functions such as creating accounts, logging into their accounts, depositing money, and withdrawing funds. In a computerized or software-based banking system, the primary features include:

Account Login: Customers access their bank accounts securely by providing their credentials (e.g., account number and password).
Deposit: Users can add money to their account balance.
Withdrawal: Customers can withdraw money from their accounts, provided they have enough funds.
Check Balance: Users can view their current account balance.
Transaction History: Optionally, banking systems can keep a record of transactions, providing users with details of their financial activities.
In a Python-based Banking System, these features are implemented using Pythonâ€™s simple and intuitive syntax. Python allows developers to build the banking system using:

Classes and Objects: To model bank accounts and manage operations such as deposits and withdrawals.
Control Structures: Python uses loops, conditionals, and input handling to create interactive menus and validate user inputs.
Data Handling: Python can store and manage account information such as account number, password, and balance securely within objects or data structures.
